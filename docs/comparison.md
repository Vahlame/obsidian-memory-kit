# Comparison

Honest positioning for **v2** (cross-platform, `basic-memory`, optional Go daemon + hybrid RAG). Opinionated one-liners; follow links for nuance.

## When to pick v2 here

You want **plain Markdown**, **git history**, **multi-IDE** access, and an incremental path to **hybrid retrieval** without running a cluster on day one.

## When not to

You need **multi-tenant SaaS memory** at API scale — use mem0 or a service you control. You need **strict sub-50ms** vector search over billions of rows — use a dedicated vector database and offline indexers.

## mem0 coexistence

mem0 is excellent for **application** memory; this pattern is for **developer / IDE** memory. They can coexist.

## Markdown vs SQLite

Markdown diffs are human-auditable; SQLite wins on constraints. We bias Markdown for agent memory; use Postgres/Qdrant for multi-tenant or high-scale product backends you control separately from this vault pattern.
