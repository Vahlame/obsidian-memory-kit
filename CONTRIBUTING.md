# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. This repository ships **cross-platform** guidance (`AGENTS.md`), optional **Go** and **Node** tooling, and archived **v1** artifacts under `docs/legacy/`.

## What this repo is and is not

- **Is:** cross-platform agent memory guidance (`AGENTS.md`), MCP sample configs, optional Go daemon, initializer, and archived v1 prompt under `docs/legacy/`.
- **Is not:** a hosted SaaS. You run MCP servers and vaults locally (or in your infra).

## Before you open a PR

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Design decisions live in `docs/adr/`; do not undo them without a new ADR.
2. For behavior touching Windows/Linux/macOS, validate on at least one target OS when feasible.
3. Run the local checks below.

## Local checks

```bash
npm ci
npm run sync-agents:check

# Markdown lint
npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" --ignore-path .markdownlintignore

# Formatting
npx prettier --check "**/*.{json,yml,yaml,md}"

# Link check
npx lychee --no-progress .

# Extract embedded PowerShell from the archived v1 prompt and lint with PSScriptAnalyzer
pwsh -File .github/scripts/extract-and-lint.ps1

# Go tests (requires Go 1.22+)
go test ./...
```

All must pass. CI mirrors these in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

3. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push.
4. GitHub Actions publishes a Release with notes copied from `CHANGELOG.md`.

SemVer interpretation for this repo:

- **MAJOR**: prompt section numbers change, or the agent contract breaks (e.g., a new mandatory parameter the user must provide).
- **MINOR**: new optional sections, new scripts, new docs, new known-error entries.
- **PATCH**: typos, wording, internal cleanups.
